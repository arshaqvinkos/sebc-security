For Transparent Data Encryption, it is required that the folder in HDFS is created as an encrypted zone before starting to write data to the folder.

In case the folders were not encrypted before, we need to first move the folder to a temporary location.

Here we have 2 databases and we need to restrict the access to each databases for different groups. 

So first step that we need to do is to have 2 separate keys and 2 separate encrypted zones, 1 for finance data and another for hr data.If we use same key for both finance and hr data,someone from HR could read data from finance.

1. Create  2 keys 1 for finance and another for hr using key_admin, which is the administrator of keys. This key_admin is different from HDFS superuser.


	 sudo -u key_admin hadoop key create key_finance

	 sudo -u key_admin hadoop key create key_hr

2. Create 2 encrypted zones in HDFS under /user/hive/warehouse

	sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hive/warehouse/finance

	sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hive/warehouse/hr

    sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName key_finance -path /user/hive/warehouse/finance

    sudo -u hdfs hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName key_hr -path /user/hive/warehouse/hr


3   Remove hdfs access for the encrypted zones

    hdfs dfs -setfacl -x user:hdfs /user/hive/warehouse/finance/
    hdfs dfs -setfacl -x user:hdfs /user/hive/warehouse/hr/

4    Give Hive access to read and write

 
    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:hive:rwx /user/hive/warehouse


5. Give managers and analysts access


    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:finance_managers:rwx /user/hive/warehouse/finance/
    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:hr_managers:rwx /user/hive/warehouse/hr/

6. Give Managers Select access to other directory

    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:finance_managers:r-x /user/hive/warehouse/hr/
    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:hr_managers:r-x /user/hive/warehouse/finance/

7. Give Analysts Select Access

 	hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:finance_analysts:r-x /user/hive/warehouse/finance/
    hdfs dfs -setfacl -m group:hr_analysts:r-x /user/hive/warehouse/hr/
